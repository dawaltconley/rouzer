// Rouzer/Lesson 1
知	zhī	To know, to understand; to know how to; knowledge.Radical 111 (矢, "arrow").Lesson 1Vocab 1
命	ming	1. To command; a command. 2. Fate; life span.*Note: What Heaven or the gods command for you is your fate. They also command your life span.Radical 30 (口, "mouth").Lesson 1Vocab 2
者	zhĕ	[A grammatical particle; see 1.3 and 7.4 for explanations.]Radical 125 (老, "old").Lesson 1Vocab 3
不	bù, bú	Not.不 always negates verbs or adjectives, so always expect a verb or adjective following it (although see also 1.1 below).Radical 1 (一, "one").Lesson 1Vocab 4
怨	yuàn	To resent; resentment, grievance.Characters with the heart radical are often verbs of emotion or thinking. 怨 usually describes the bitterness, sadness, and anger that result from being treated unfairly.Radical 61 (心, "heart").Lesson 1Vocab 5
天	tiān	Sky, heavens; "Heaven."This character is often used in a generalized sense for the Powers That Be.Radical 37 (大, "big").Lesson 1Vocab 6
己	jĭ	Oneself; self, ego.This character usually appears as the direct object of a verb (as in the text of this lesson) or as a possessive adjective (i.e., 不怨己命, "to not resent one's own fate"). Do not confuse it with 已 (247; "already," "to end").Radical 49 (己).Lesson 1Vocab 7
人	rén	1. Person, people, human beings. * 2. Others, other people. *Antonym (meaning \# 2 ): 己 (7).Radical 9 (人).Lesson 1Vocab 8
禍	huò	Disaster, misfortune, bad luck.Note the compressed version of the radical on the left side. Characters with this radical frequently have something to do with religious ceremonies or phenomena with a supernatural agency.Radical 113 (示, "to show").Lesson 1Vocab 9
生	shēng	1. To be born, to arise from; to give birth to; to be alive; to raise; to grow; alive; life. * 2. Master, Mister. [polite suffix]Note that the subject of the verb can be the thing that produces or the thing that is produced.  For example: 人生, "A person is born" (or "a person lives/is alive"); 怨生禍, "Resentment gives birth to disaster."Radical 100 (生).Lesson 1Vocab 10
於	yú	[A multipurpose preposition.]This is one of the most common characters in literary Chinese; another character, 于 (344), is often used interchangeably with it. Translate based on the context (see 1.4).Radical 70 (方, "square").Lesson 1Vocab 11
欲	yù	To desire, to want, to want to; desires, wants.In later literary Chinese, this character could also mark a future action ("about to"). For that reason, 欲生 would come to mean (for example) "wish to give birth" or "was about to give birth."Radical 76 (欠, "to owe").Lesson 1Vocab 12
得	dé	1. To get, to obtain; gain, profit. * 2. To succeed in, to be able to (accompanies other verb).Example of meaning #2: 得生, "to succeed in being alive," "to succeed in being born."  (Compare this to the vernacular English "Did you get to go to the store yesterday?")Radical 60 (ㄔ, "to step with the left foot").Lesson 1Vocab 13
福	fú	Good fortune, prosperity.Antonym: 禍 (9).Radical 113 (示).Lesson 1Vocab 14
自	zì	1. Oneself; personally, naturally, spontaneously. * 2. From (used to indicate movement away from).In meaning #1, 自 is sometimes used to put special emphasis on the subject. For example, 自知 usually means "to know [something] oneself." Contrast this with 知己, "to know oneself" (although see also 1 a, Lesson 14). Writers are sometimes rather vague about using 自 and 己; context should be your guide. Meaning #2 (usually translated into English as the preposition "from") is actually a kind of coverb (see 1.5 for an explanation of this term).Radical 132 (自).Lesson 1Vocab 15
禁	jìn	To control, to prohibit, to restrain.Radical 113 (示).Lesson 1Vocab 16
聖	shèng	Sage, wise person, saint; sagely; wise.In Confucianism, the word is applied to the greatest men, Confucius especially. In Buddhism, it can refer to the Buddha or to Bodhisattvas.Radical 128 (耳, "ear").Lesson 1Vocab 17
以	yĭ	1. With, by means of. [coverb]* 2. In order to. [conjunction]For more on this very common and troublesome character, see 1.5 and 1.6 below.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 1Vocab 18
心	xīn	Heart, mind, state of mind, attitude.In Chinese culture, the heart is the source of both emotions and thinking.Radical 61 (心).Lesson 1Vocab 19
導	dăo	To lead.This character could be interpreted as the verbal equivalent of 道, "road," "path"---in other words, "to show [someone] the road."Radical 41 (寸, "thumb").Lesson 1Vocab 20
耳	ĕr	1. Ear. * 2. "And that is all"; "and that is the end of it." [sentence completion particle]The second meaning is a "phonetic fusion" of the two characters 而已; this usage will be encountered later.Radical 128 (耳).Lesson 1Vocab 21
目	mù	Eye; to look at, to glare at.Radical 109 (目).Lesson 1Vocab 22
小	xiăo	Little, petty, insignificant; to consider small, to scorn.The expression 小人 (found frequently in Confucian writing, but in other places as well) refers to a person with mean, egotistical instincts who cares only about himself and his own comforts.Radical 42 (小).Lesson 1Vocab 23
為	wéi (1, 3); wèi (2)	1. To do, to make, to be, to become. * 2. For the sake of, because of, on behalf of (see 4.2 ). 3. [Marks a passive sentence pattern; see 31 *.* 11 .]This character is one of the most common in literary Chinese. Meanings #2 and #3 will be encountered and explained later, so don't worry about them now!Radical 87 (爪, "claw").Lesson 1Vocab 24
善	shàn	1. Good, excellent, virtuous; good [thing]; excellent [thing]. * 2. To be good or skilled at [something].This character refers either to virtuous, moral behavior or to talent and skill. Don't confuse it with 喜 (46).Radical 30 (口).Lesson 1Vocab 25
報	bào	1. To repay, to reward; repayment. * 2. To avenge; revenge. 3. Report; to report.Whereas generally referring to the idea of repayment, this character can imply either reward for good things or forms of revenge or vengeance. It often refers to heavenly justice.Radical 32 (土, "earth").Lesson 1Vocab 26
德	dé	1. Virtue, power. * 2. Good deed; to do a good deed.Although in most literary Chinese texts this character refers to the modern sense of "virtue," in early texts it sometimes implies inner (almost magical) power or charisma. Some scholars have argued that it is the power one possesses to make another obliged or grateful to oneself (and this in turn led to meaning #2). One of the names of the Lăozĭ 老子 is Dàodéjīng 道德經, "Classic of the Way and Its Power."Radical 60 (彳).Lesson 1Vocab 27

// Rouzer/Lesson 2
君	jūn	1. Ruler, lord. * 2. [Polite second person pronoun; compare Elizabethan English "My Lord . . . ."]Radical 30 (口).Lesson 2Vocab 28
子	zĭ	1. Son, child. * 2. Master. [polite suffix, like 生 ( 10-2 )] 3. You. [pronoun] 4. "Viscount" (a feudal title; see 4 *.* 1 below).Radical 39 (子).Lesson 2Vocab 29
君子	jūn zĭ	Son of a lord; a gentleman, a superior man.From the time of the Analects---a text purporting to record the sayings of Confucius---this term increasingly came to refer to men of superior moral standards and intellect. Often used as an antonym to 小人.Lesson 2Vocab 28a
有	yŏu	1. To possess, to own, to have; possession. * 2. Being, existence; to exist, to be [in a place or among a group].The second group of meanings represents the existence of something within a group or at a location. For example: 有憂 could be translated simply as "there is worry"; 君子有  善人 could be translated as "among gentlemen there are virtuous men."Radical 74 (月,Lesson 2Vocab 30
終	zhōng	To end, to die; ending; finally.When meaning "to die," this word usually implies by natural causes, after a full life (e.g., 君得終, "the ruler succeeded in living out his natural life span").Radical 120 (糸, "silk floss").Lesson 2Vocab 31
身	shēn	Body, the self, oneself; personally, on one's own.Sometimes it is difficult to tell with this character whether the author intends an emphasis on the physical body one possesses or whether he/she intends an abstract sense. Synonym ("oneself"): 自 (15).Radical 158 (身).Lesson 2Vocab 32
終身	zhōng shēn	All one's life, to the end of one's life.Lesson 2Vocab 31a
之	zhī	1. [A particle that connects nouns or noun clauses; see discussion in 2 *.* 1 .]* 2. Him, her, it, them. [direct object pronoun] 3. To go.This is easily the most common character in literary Chinese. It has three chief uses, all of which you should learn thoroughly. Beware! Meaning #3 is fairly common, but rare compared to the other two meanings. Consequently, it is quite typical for readers to overlook it when it occurs (it occurs for the first time in our texts in Lesson 6, and once each in Lessons 25 and 27).Radical 4 (丿).Lesson 2Vocab 33
憂	yōu	Worry, anxiety, concern; to worry [about].Radical 61 (心).Lesson 2Vocab 34
而	ér	But, and, then.This word only connects two verbs. Its meaning is often very vague; see 2.3.Radical 126Lesson 2Vocab 35
無	wú	1. To not have; nonpossession. * 2. Nonexistence, nothingness; to not exist. 3. "Don't . . . ." [negative imperative]This verb is the opposite of 有. Note that unlike 不, which is only an adverb and must precede a verb, 無 (in meanings #1 and #2) is a verb in itself. Meaning #3 is actually a substitute for the "proper" negative imperative, 毋. This usage will not occur until Lesson 23.Radical 86 (火, "fire").Lesson 2Vocab 36
一	yī	One; first; once.Literary Chinese usually does not make a distinction between ordinal and cardinal numbers. Context will tell you how to read this character.Radical 1 (一).Lesson 2Vocab 37
朝	zhāo (1--2); cháo (3)	1. Morning, dawn. * 2. First day of the lunar month. 3. [Royal or imperial] court; to hold court, to go to court, to summon to court.Radical 74 (月).Lesson 2Vocab 38
一朝	yīzhāo	Right away, immediately, in a brief period of time.Lesson 2Vocab 37a
患	huàn	Grief, misfortune, disaster; to suffer, to worry about [a crisis].Note that the text is contrasting this more serious character with the milder 憂.Radical 61Lesson 2Vocab 39
順	shùn	To act in accordance with, to agree with, to obey; favorable.Radical 181 (頁, "leaf of a book").Lesson 2Vocab 40
道	dào	1. Road, path; skill, method; philosophy; the right way to live. * 2. To speak, to say.You probably already know the cultural significance of 道. Although it gave its name to the Taoist (Daoist) religion and philosophy, all Chinese philosophies and religions use "the Way" to indicate the proper path in life.Radical 162 (辵, "walking").Lesson 2Vocab 41
行	xíng (1); xìng (2)	1. To go, to walk; to act; to conduct [affairs]; to carry out [an action]; to circulate [information, currency, etc.]; to practice, to put into practice. * 2. Behavior; conduct.行 is one of the most common characters in literary Chinese, and it is used for many actions. Most importantly, the basic meaning "to go" extends to ideas of behavior and conduct.Radical 144 (行).Lesson 2Vocab 42
循	xún	To follow, to comply with.This character is a near synonym for 順 (40). The text uses it here for variety's sake.Radical 60 (彳).Lesson 2Vocab 43
理	lĭ	, iPrinciples; pattern, rationale; to straighten, to arrange, to put in order.  In much later Chinese philosophy---the Neo-Confucianism that began in the eleventh century---this character was used to represent the cosmic order and the pattern of things. In the early period, its meaning is somewhat more modest and can be anything from the stripes on a tiger to the right way to do something. It originally meant "to polish gems in accordance with their veins."Radical 96 (玉, "jade").Lesson 2Vocab 44
言	yán	To speak, to say; words, speech.When 言 takes an object, it usually is the topic of speech. For example: 人言禍, "People talk about disaster."Radical 149 (言).Lesson 2Vocab 45
喜	xĭ	To be happy, to be delighted; to enjoy [something]; joy, pleasure.Do not confuse this character with 善 (25).Radical 30 (口).Lesson 2Vocab 46
加	jiā	1. To increase. 2. To participate [in], to be of benefit. 3. Increasingly, more. * 4. To apply [to]. 5. Advantage, gain.The adverbial usage ("increasingly, more") may seem a little odd. It functions as a way to express "comparatives" ( -er adjectives in English). Examples: 君子不加小, "The gentle-man does not become any smaller"; 小人不加聖, "The petty person does not become any wiser."Radical 19 (力, "strength").Lesson 2Vocab 47
易	yì	1. Easy; easily. * 2. Change; to change, to exchange; the Book of Changes (a Chinese classic).The first use is often in conjunction with another verb to express the idea "easy to . . ."  For example: 易導, "easy to lead"; 易行, "easy to carry out." See also 7.3.Radical 72 (日,Lesson 2Vocab 48
怒	nù	Angry; anger.Radical 61 (心).Lesson 2Vocab 49
難	nán (1); nàn (2)	1. Difficult, hard to deal with. * 2. Difficulty, problem.Meaning #1 is often used with a verb to express the idea "difficult to . . ." For example: 難  導, "difficult to lead"; 難行, "difficult to carry out" (compare 易 [48]; see also 7.3).Radical 172 (隹, "short-tailed bird").Lesson 2Vocab 50
下	xià	Under, below; to go down, to descend, to put down; social inferiors; to give to a social inferior.This character can refer to anything "below" something else, or any movement from above to below.Radical 1 (一).Lesson 2Vocab 51
天下	tiān xià	"Under Heaven" (i.e., the world).Chinese writers tended to use this term to represent all territory under Chinese control, not necessarily every place in existence. The scholar A. C. Graham has rendered it as "the empire." Constrast it with 國 (57).Lesson 2Vocab 6a
失	shī	To lose, to be remiss, to neglect; loss, failure.Radical 37 (大).Lesson 2Vocab 52
後	hòu	1. Behind, later, subsequently, afterward; to follow behind; to consider of lesser importance. * 2. Posterity, successor, heir.This character can generally refer to anything that is behind something else, or (verbally) a movement toward the rear or a dismissal of something as "secondary" or "less important."Radical 60 (彳).Lesson 2Vocab 53
而後	ér hòu	And then, only then.This phrase emphasizes that a first event must happen before a second event can occur.Lesson 2Vocab 35a
仁	rén	Kindness, benevolence.One of the most important Confucian virtues.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 2Vocab 54
義	yì	1. Righteousness, justice; righteous, just. * 2. Principles, ethical principles; principled, upright. 3. Meaning, significance, main point.In Confucian philosophy the first meaning is often linked with 仁; one represents the "softer," more compassionate side of virtue, the other one the "harder," more upright side.  The second meaning has the broader sense of moral standards or ideals (as in English, when we say "she is a principled person"). The third usage (which developed later than the others) has the vaguest meaning of all, and in this sense the character is sometimes used interchangeably with 意 (556).Radical 123 (羊, "sheep").Lesson 2Vocab 55
焉	yān	1. [An object pronoun.]* 2. How. [question word]In meaning #1 (by far the more common), this word generally represents a combination of 於 + object pronoun (e.g., "from him," "to her," "toward it," etc.). Sometimes it's best to translate it as a location pronoun: here or there. In this text, "here" or "from this" would be most appropriate. Meaning #2 will not occur until Lesson 27.Radical 86 (火).Lesson 2Vocab 56
國	guó	Country, state, capital city.In ancient China, this character could apply to different concepts. Before the unification of China under the Qin 秦 empire (221--207 b.c.e.), independent states were called 國. However, at the earliest stage, the term could be applied to the "capital city" of a state (and, in fact, states in the early period were more like Greek city-states---metropolises with vaguely defined territory around them). In the imperial period, 國 could apply to territory controlled by a member of the royal house or a loyal retainer ("fiefdom"). Basically, all 國 taken together constitute 天下 (6 a).Radical 31 (囗, "enclosure").Lesson 2Vocab 57
家	jiā	1. House, household, family. * 2. School of thought.In the early period, the term 國家 as a combination word meaning "country" had not quite evolved yet. Rather, 家 is contrasted with 國 to represent either the private realm (family, as opposed to country), or the noble families and clans that ruled the 國. The character itself represents a domestic animal under a roof.Radical 40 (宀, "roof").Lesson 2Vocab 58
治	chí (1); zhì (2)	1. To govern well, to put in order. * 2. Government, administration.For a discussion of the literary Chinese pronunciation of this character, see 2.7 below.Radical 85 (水, "water").Lesson 2Vocab 59
孝	xiào	Filial; filiality, filial piety.Another one of the most important Confucian virtues. 不孝 means "unfilial" or "unfiliality."Radical 39 (子).Lesson 2Vocab 60
民	mín	The common people.This character usually describes the people as a group; it is rare to see an individual called a 民, unless his commoner status is being stressed.Radical 83 (氏, "clan," "family").Lesson 2Vocab 61
爭	zhēng	1. To vie, to compete, to struggle, to fight. * 2. To try one's hardest, to be eager to, to vie [with others to accomplish something].The second use accompanies another verb and represents the eagerness of people to do something. For example: 民爭為善, "The people struggle to/compete to do good" (i.e., they are all extremely eager to do good).Radical 87 (爪).Lesson 2Vocab 62
分	fēn (1); fèn (2)	1. To divide up, to apportion, to share. * 2. Share, lot, fate.Note that the knife radical suggests the character's original meaning: cutting something into pieces and dividing it.Radical 18 (刀, "knife").Lesson 2Vocab 63
慈	cí	Compassion, sympathy; compassionate.Radical 61 (心).Lesson 2Vocab 64
惠	huì	Compassion; compassionate.慈惠 is an example of a synonym compound---two words with roughly the same meaning put together, sometimes for emphasis, sometimes to create a symmetrical rhythm. Up to this point in the lesson text, the expression 而後 has been followed by a two-character phrase: first 仁義, then 孝子. Although the author could express his meaning here with only the character 慈, the symmetry of the phrases forces him to insert a synonym.Radical 61 (心).Lesson 2Vocab 65
逆	nì	To go against [the right], to be perverse, to go awry.Radical 162 (辵).Lesson 2Vocab 66
時	shí	Time, the times, the era.(之) 時 is often used to mark a temporal clause. For example, 聖人治天下之時，民爭為  善, "When a sagely person governs the world, then the people vie to do good."Radical 72Lesson 2Vocab 67
反	făn	1. To revolt; to go astray; to be perverse. * 2. To return. 3. On the contrary, contrary to expectations.In all meanings, the idea of a countermotion is implied by this character.Radical 29 (又,Lesson 2Vocab 68
權	quán	1. To weigh, to balance [physical objects]. 2. Circumstances, contingencies, temporary situation. * 3. Influence, authority, power.Radical 75 (木, "tree").Lesson 2Vocab 69
謀	móu	Plans, schemes, strategy; to plot, to plan; resourceful.This word can have either a positive connotation (to make strategies, to consult, to plan) or a negative one (to scheme, to plot). As a verb, it takes as its object either the thing that is being planned (聖人謀善, "The wise person plans a good thing") or the thing that is being plotted against (小人謀國, "The petty person plotted against the state").Radical 149 (言).Lesson 2Vocab 70
權謀	quán móu	Grand strategies, provisional plans; resourcefulness.This compound obviously derives from the idea of the plans 謀 one develops in certain circumstances 權.Lesson 2Vocab 69a

其	qí	1. This; that; these; those; its; his; her; their. [possessive and demonstrative adjective]* 2. Perhaps, probably, should. [vague modal adverb]This character is extremely common in literary Chinese constructions. For details of the first meaning, see 3.1.

事	shì	1. Thing, matter, affair, occupation, job. * 2. To serve, to work for; to employ, to have as a servant.In modern Mandarin Chinese, 物 (72) tends to apply to physical objects, whereas 事 applies to matters, affairs, and abstract things. This holds true to a certain extent in literary Chinese, but there is some confusion of the terms.Radical 6 (亅).Lesson 3Vocab 76
成	chéng	To complete; to accomplish; to perfect; to become.This character is quite common in both transitive use (君成德, "The ruler perfects his virtue") and intransitive use (德成, "Virtue comes to perfection").Radical 62 (戈, "spear").Lesson 3Vocab 77
所	suŏ	1. Place, location. 2. [Grammatical particle: turns a verb into a direct object.]*The second use of this character is fairly complicated and will probably cause you some difficulty. For details, see 3.3 below.Radical 63 (戶, "door").Lesson 3Vocab 78

歸	guī	To go home; to give allegiance to; to find refuge with.This character expresses the action of going to where one "belongs" (in traditional conception). Rivers 歸 to the sea.

愛	ài	To love; to cherish; to begrudge.This character usually does not imply "romantic love" in literary Chinese, as it does in the modern East Asian languages.Radical 61 (心).Lesson 3Vocab 82

宿	sù	1. To roost; to lodge, to spend the night; lodging, inn. * 2. Previous, former.As one might conclude from the usages above, the character can refer both to animals roosting for the night and to humans spending the night somewhere (often temporarily).  From there, the meaning of "inn" or "lodging" developed.Radical 40 (宀).Lesson 3Vocab 94

士	shì	Knight; military officer; gentleman; gentry.The meaning of this character changes depending on the historical period. At the time of this text, it often referred to a land-owning "middle class," sometimes warriors, sometimes scholars. Many of these people were literate, and most of the literature and philosophy of the time was produced by them. Socially, they were located between the aristocrats and the rulers on the one side, and the common people on the other.Radical 33 (士).Lesson 3Vocab 96

齊	qí	1. The state of Qi. * 2. To be equal, to be the same.Regarding meaning #1: 齊 was a state in pre-imperial China, occupying part of the area of Shandong 山東 province. This is the first of a number of state names you will learn.  Because so much of traditional Chinese culture refers back to the early period, you should become familiar with them.Radical 210 (齊).Lesson 4Vocab 102

齊桓公	qí huán gōng	Duke Huan of Qi.He reigned from 685 to 643 b.c.e. As with the names of the states, you should familiarize yourself with some of the more famous rulers and historical figures of the pre-imperial period. For more on the importance of Duke Huan, see 25.1.Lesson 4Vocab 102a

臣	chén	1. Minister; subject [of a ruler]. * 2. [First person pronoun when addressing a superior.]*Pay special attention to the pronoun use. This is comparable to archaic English usages like  "Your Humble Servant."Radical 131 (臣).Lesson 4Vocab 106

酒	jiŭ	1. Alcoholic beverage. 2. Banquet. [figurative usage]This character has usually been translated as "wine," but you should keep in mind that alcoholic beverages at this time were probably brewed from grains---that is, they were closer to beer. Fermented rice beverages (like Japanese sake) and strong distilled beverages were not made until much later.Radical 164 (酉, "fermented millet").Lesson 4Vocab 108

中	zhōng (1); zhòng (2)	1. Middle, midst. * 2. To hit on target, to strike the middle of.Note the change of tone in the second, verbal meaning (which is often used in discussions of archery).Radical 2 (丨).Lesson 4Vocab 111
日中	rì zhōng	Noon ("middle of the day").Lesson 4Vocab 110a
管	guăn	Tube; pipe, flute.In this anecdote the character is being used as a person's surname. In the course of this textbook you'll find that you'll have to learn many characters even though they may only occur as names in the lesson texts.Radical 118 (竹, "bamboo").Lesson 4Vocab 112
仲	zhòng	The second in order of birth.This character is used most often to differentiate the middle of three siblings, or to indicate an uncle's age in relation to other uncles. See 仲父 (113 a). However, in this anecdote it is a personal name.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 4Vocab 113
管仲	guăn zhòng	Guan Zhong.A prominent minister of 齊桓公, he became famous as a model adviser and strategist, and many anecdotes are told about him. A book of political advice, the Guanzi 管子, is attributed to him, but it was probably composed after his death.Lesson 4Vocab 112a
至	zhì	1. To arrive. * 2. To go so far as; to reach the point of. 3. When, when the time came that. 4. The ultimate, the most, the perfect.This is an especially common character. In addition to its straightforward verbal usage, it has a number of more abstract uses. The second meaning can be used in expressions representing the extent to which an action may be carried out. For example: 報至死, "he took revenge to the extent of death"---he took revenge even to the extent that he risked death or killed his enemy. The third meaning can be used as a simple time marker. For example: 至行齊, "when he went to Qi . . . ." The last meaning is used as an adverb to represent the superlative degree of some quality. For example: 至善, "the most perfect good," "the high-est degree of good."Radical 133 (至).Lesson 4Vocab 114

觴	shāng	Cup, goblet, drinking cup; to offer a toast.The radical suggests that this character originally indicated a drinking vessel carved from the horn of an animal.Radical 148 (角, "animal horns").Lesson 4Vocab 116

曰	yuē	1. To say, to speak. * 2. To be named, to be called.Do not confuse this character with 日 (110), which is thinner. This verb appears most commonly as an introducer of direct speech, but the second usage is common when introducing names. See 4.4.Radical 73 (曰).Lesson 4Vocab 120
可	kĕ	To be feasible, to be allowable, to be permissible.Although this character commonly appears by itself, it typically occurs with a verb as well (see 7.3).Radical 30 (口).Lesson 4Vocab 121
乎	hū	1. [Question particle: ends a sentence, indicating a question.]* 2. [An exclamation particle, indicating surprise or emphasis.] 3. [A dialect substitution for the multipurpose preposition 於 .]For the first (and most typical) meaning, see 4.5 below . The other usages are fairly common as well (#2 is first encountered in Lesson 7, #3 in Lesson 21), making this a somewhat confusing character for beginning students.Radical 4 (丿).Lesson 4Vocab 122
對	duì	To reply, to answer.Radical 41 (寸).Lesson 4Vocab 123
聞	wén	1. To hear. * 2. To smell. 3. Learning, fame, reputation (i.e., "what is heard").This is by far the most common verb for hearing. It is also commonly used (as in this case) to introduce a proverb or a common saying: "I have heard . . . ."Radical 128 (耳).Lesson 4Vocab 124

笑	xiào	To laugh; to smile.Often, literary Chinese clarifies which meaning is meant by using 大笑 for "laugh" (which will appear in Lesson 6). As a transitive verb, 笑 means "to laugh at [someone/something]."Radical 118 (竹).Lesson 4Vocab 130
父	fù	Father.Radical 88 (父).Lesson 4Vocab 131
仲父	zhòng fu	Uncle.Applied to a "middle" uncle (neither the oldest nor youngest). In this text, 齊桓公 uses it as a term of respect and affection to his minister, who was "like an uncle" to him. This usage implies that 管仲 was old enough to be his uncle, but not excessively old. It is probably coincidental that 管仲's personal name was 仲.Lesson 4Vocab 113a
起	qĭ	To rise; to get up [from sleep].Radical 156 (走).Lesson 4Vocab 132

坐	zuò	1. To sit; seat, place [at a banquet or meeting]. * 2. To try [someone] on criminal charges; to be brought to court [on a charge].Until the Song 宋 dynasty (960--1279 c.e.) and the widespread use of chairs in China, the Chinese sat cross-legged on mats (as the Japanese often still do).

曾	zēng (1); céng (2)	1. Zeng. [a surname]* 2. Once in the past. [adverb tense marker]Radical 73 (曰).Lesson 5Vocab 135
曾子	zēng zĭ	Master Zeng (one of Confucius' disciples).Note the meaning of 子 (29 - 2) when used as a suffix in polite designations.Lesson 5Vocab 135a
衣	yī (1); yì (2)	1. Clothes, robe. * 2. To put on clothes, to wear clothes. *Note that each part of speech has a different tone.Radical 145 (衣).Lesson 5Vocab 136
弊	bì	Worn out, tattered.Radical 55 (廾, "joined hands").Lesson 5Vocab 137
耕	gēng	To plow.Radical 127 (耒, "plow").Lesson 5Vocab 138
魯	lŭ	The state of Lu.Located southwest of Qi 齊 (102), it was most famous as the home state of Confucius and of Confucian studies in general.Radical 195 (魚).Lesson 5Vocab 139
使	shĭ (1, 3); shì (2)	1. To send, to make, to cause. * 2. To go on a mission; emissary, ambassador. 3. If, supposing.For significant grammatical structures using this character, see 5.1 below.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 5Vocab 140
往	wăng	To go.Radical 60 (彳).Lesson 5Vocab 141
致	zhì	To present; to elicit; to make come; to bring about; to convey.This character has a wide range of meanings and may cause you some confusion. One way to interpret it is to see it as the "causative" equivalent of 至, "to arrive" (114). Thus, "to present" a gift is to make it arrive at its destination; to elicit an emotion is to make it come; and so forth.Radical 133 (至).Lesson 5Vocab 142
邑	yì	District city; county; region.Towns were often given as temporary fiefdoms to prominent ministers or even simply to men of virtue; the recipients could draw income from its tax revenues.Radical 163 (邑).Lesson 5Vocab 143
請	qĭng	1. To request. * 2. To pay a polite visit to.This character produces some confusion because it can imply both a request for permission to do something and a request that someone else do something. For example: 臣請往魯, "I  [your humble minister] request to go to Lu"; 請君往魯, "I request that you, My Lord, go to Lu." Sometimes only context will make clear how to interpret its use.Radical 149 (言).Lesson 5Vocab 144
此	cĭ	Here; this, these.This character is very common and refers most often to a place, though sometimes to people or things.Radical 77 (止).Lesson 5Vocab 145
修	xiū	To repair, to mend; to regulate; to cultivate.Sometimes this character can have a very concrete, matter-of-fact usage, as in this lesson's text. However, in expressions such as 修身, "to cultivate the body/self," it can refer to philosophical cultivation or yogic/ascetic practice. It turns up often in Buddhist writing.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 5Vocab 146
受	shòu	To receive.Radical 29 (又).Lesson 5Vocab 147
復	fù	1. Again; moreover.* 2. To return; to repay; to report.This character occurs in a wide variety of contexts, and it usually implies repetition of some sort. As a verb, it represents reciprocation (to return something or to repay something, or to report on a situation, usually after returning from a mission---compare 報 [26]). As an adverb, 復 can be exceedingly vague, implying the repetition of the same action or merely the occurrence of a different action related to the first (in which case it is often left untranslated). It also occurs frequently with the negative 不, when it can cause some problems of interpretation: 復不往 would mean "again does not go" (i.e., someone has not come in two instances), whereas 不復往 (which is much more common) means "does not again go"  (i.e., does not go any more).Radical 60 (彳).Lesson 5Vocab 148
又	yòu	Again; moreover.This character is frequently used as a synonym for 復 (148). However, 又 often emphasizes irritation, disgust, or unexpected repetition. For example, with negatives, 又不往 means  "again [he] didn't come!" (He stood us up again!) Perhaps because of the special emphasizing function of 又, 不又往 does not occur at all.Radical 29 (又).Lesson 5Vocab 149
先	xiān	First, earlier; first; in front; to be first; to go first; to put first.This character has much the same range of use as its opposite, 後 (53).Radical 10 (儿,Lesson 5Vocab 150
先生	xiān shēng	Master (lit., "first born").A polite form of address, somewhat more polite than 生 by itself, which can also be used.Lesson 5Vocab 150a
非	fēi	1. "Is not," "it is not the case that . . . ." [negative particle]* 2. Wrong.For this character's use, see 5.3 below .Radical 175 (非).Lesson 5Vocab 151
求	qiú	To seek, to request, to look for.Radical 85 (水).Lesson 5Vocab 152
則	zé	Then.This character is often optional and is used to clarify what might otherwise be an unclear relationship between clauses; it is typically found in both "Since . . . then . . ." and "If . . .  then . . ." sentences. In our lesson text, it is used to emphasize that since 曾子 did not ask for anything, then the messenger can conclude that the town was freely given as a present.Radical 18 (刀).Lesson 5Vocab 153
獻	xiàn	To present, to give, to offer (often to a superior).Radical 94 (犬, "dog").Lesson 5Vocab 154
奚	xī	How, what. [question word]For a brief discussion of question forms, see 5.5 below.Radical 37 (大).Lesson 5Vocab 155
奚為	xī wèi	Why. [question word]This term can be interpreted as an inversion of 為奚, "on behalf of what?" with 為 functioning as a coverb (4.2). For inversions, see 5.6 below.Lesson 5Vocab 155a
予	yŭ (1); yú (2)	1. To give. * 2. I, me. [first person pronoun]Radical 6 (亅).Lesson 5Vocab 156
驕	jiāo	Arrogant, proud, high-spirited; to treat someone arrogantly.Radical 187 (馬, "horse").Lesson 5Vocab 157
縱	zòng	Even if.Radical 120 (糸).Lesson 5Vocab 158
賜	cì	To give [as a present]; gift.This character is a close synonym to 獻 (154); however, 獻 often represents a social inferior giving a present to a superior, while 賜 represents a superior granting something to an inferior.  Note that 魯君 uses 獻 politely to describe his gift to 曾子, whereas 曾子 politely uses 賜 for the same gift. 予 (156), however, is relatively indifferent to social class.Radical 154 (貝).Lesson 5Vocab 159
我	wŏ	I, me. [first person pronoun]Radical 62 (戈).Lesson 5Vocab 160
也	yĕ	[Particle.]This character can place a special emphasis on a phrase. The particle has a number of other functions, which we will explore later. For the time being, just think of it as indicating an emphasis.Radical 5 (乙).Lesson 5Vocab 161
能	néng	To be able to, can; to be capable, to be able; ability, talent.Radical 130 (肉, 月, "flesh").Lesson 5Vocab 162
勿	wù	Do not. [imperative]For details on the use of this character, see 5.7 below.Radical 20 (勹, "package").Lesson 5Vocab 163
孔	kŏng	1. Hole; nostril. 2. Kong. [a surname]*Radical 39 (子).Lesson 5Vocab 164
孔子	kŏng zĭ	Master Kong (Confucius).The Western version of the name actually derives from a latinization of Kŏngfūzĭ 孔夫子, an even more honorific title for the philosopher.Lesson 5Vocab 164a
參	cān (1); shēn (2)	1. To counsel; to consult; to participate. 2. Shen. [a personal name]*This character is a fairly common verb, and you should learn its meanings. However, in this case, the word (in its second pronunciation, shēn) is simply the personal name of 曾  子. Obviously Confucius would refer to his own student by his personal name, not by an honorific title.Radical 28 (ㄙ).Lesson 5Vocab 165
足	zú	1. To be sufficient, to be enough; to be competent at. * 2. Foot.This character is often used an auxiliary verb, in the expression 足以, "be sufficient to . . ."; see 7.3 for further details.Radical 157 (足).Lesson 5Vocab 166

節	jié	Joint (originally, of bamboo); segment; virtue, chastity, self-restraint; virtuous, chaste.Radical 118 (竹).Lesson 5Vocab 168

// Rouzer/Lesson 6
趙	zhào	The state (and family) of Zhao.At first, one of the major aristocratic clans of the state of Jin 晉; later, a feudal state in pre-imperial China, located mostly in modern Shanxi 山西. See 169 a below for details.Radical 156 (走).Lesson 6Vocab 169
簡	jiăn	1. Bamboo slip, document. 2. To abridge; to be simple; to examine.Here, the character is used in a person's title. Though this is a fairly common character, it does not appear in our texts outside of names.Radical 118 (竹).Lesson 6Vocab 170
趙簡子	zhào jiăn zi	Viscount Jian of Zhao.At this time, the feudal state of 趙 (controlled by the 趙 clan) was part of the larger state of Jin 晉. 趙簡子 was one of the greatest military leaders of his clan. In the time of his son, 晉 fell apart into three independent states, 趙 being one of them (see Lesson 14 for more details).Lesson 6Vocab 169a
兵	bīng	Weapon; troops.The character originally meant "weapon" but soon came to refer to soldiers as well.Radical 12 (八).Lesson 6Vocab 171
攻	gōng	To attack.Radical 66 (攴; "to rap").Lesson 6Vocab 172
令	lìng	1. To command, to make, to allow; an order, a command. * 2. Local magistrate.Synonyms (meaning \# 1 ): 使 (140 , verb only); 命 (2). There are some differences between 使 and 令. 使 is often used specifically to apply to acts of sending (e.g., to send diplomatic missions or emissaries), whereas 令 often refers to commands (from commanders or rulers).Radical 9 (人).Lesson 6Vocab 173
軍	jūn	Army.Radical 159 (軍, "carriage," "cart").Lesson 6Vocab 174
敢	găn	To dare to, to have the audacity to; daring, audacious; audacity.This character normally functions in conjunction with another verb. You will often find it when a social inferior wishes to soften a statement he is making to a superior ("I dare to tell Your Majesty . . .").Radical 66 (攵).Lesson 6Vocab 175
諫	jiàn	To remonstrate with.This word has strong political (and later, Confucian) connotations; specifically, it is used in situations where a minister or servant feels it his duty to criticize his superior's actions.Radical 149 (言).Lesson 6Vocab 176
罪	zuì	Sin, crime, punishment, blame; to commit a crime; to punish, to blame.Notice the seemingly contradictory meanings---that both the criminal act and the punishment for it can be represented by the same character. Context will usually make the meaning clear.Radical 122 (网, "net").Lesson 6Vocab 177
披	pī	To drape over the shoulders, to wear on the back.Radical 64 (手, "hand").Lesson 6Vocab 178
甲	jiă	Armor, suit of armor, coat of armor.Radical 102 (田, "field").Lesson 6Vocab 179
名	míng	Name, reputation, fame; to be named, to be called.Radical 30 (口).Lesson 6Vocab 180
盧	lú	Lu. [a personal name]You may often encounter this character as a surname.Radical 108 (皿, "vessel," "utensil").Lesson 6Vocab 181
公盧	gōng lú	Gong Lu. [a proper name]Note that 公 is a surname here (104 - 2), not a feudal title.Lesson 6Vocab 104a
望	wàng	To gaze at from a distance; to hope, to aspire to, to expect; hopes, aspirations.The character moved from its concrete meaning of "gaze at from a distance" to include a more abstract "gazing"---that is, looking off into the future for what one desires. Here, the concrete meaning is used.Radical 74 (月).Lesson 6Vocab 182
見	jiàn (1--3); xian (4)	1. To see. * 2. [Marker of the passive voice; see 9 *.* 3 .] 3. To have an audience with [the ruler], to grant an audience to. 4. To appear, to be made manifest, to seem (used for 現 ).Radical 147 (見).Lesson 6Vocab 183
何	hé	What, how, why. [question word]This character is the most common of all question words. Synonym: 奚 (155). Note that in our lesson text, it is serving either as the adverb "why" ("Why are you laughing?") or as the direct object of 笑, placed idiomatically before the verb ("What are you laughing at?").  See 5.5.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 6Vocab 184
乃	năi	But, then, just, only then.This character is very difficult to pin down, because its use is heavily modal (i.e., it often illustrates a feeling or a mood and does not convey a precise meaning). In this case, 公盧  means to denigrate his own laughter, so "just" is probably the best translation.Radical 4Lesson 6Vocab 185
有以	yŏu yĭ	To have the means to, to have the wherewithal to.These characters are followed by a verb. The phrase's antonym, obviously, is 無以. Pulleyblank points out that 有以 is a contraction of 有所以, "to have that by which" ( Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar, p. 49). If that is too complicated for you to grasp easily at this point, it is probably best just to take the term as I define it here.Lesson 6Vocab 30a
解	jiĕ	To untie, to loosen, to get rid of; to solve [a problem]; to break [a siege]; to explain.The wide range of meanings for this character all derive from its meaning "to untie" (and hence, to alleviate some difficult situation).Radical 148 (角).Lesson 6Vocab 186
當	dāng (1--2); dang (3)	1. Occupying [a place or time]; facing. * 2. To be about to. [future marker] 3. Ought, should, must; to accept as suitable.This character has a wide variety of meanings. We can divide these into three categories: a verbal meaning emphasizing time, occupation, or position; an adverbial meaning emphasizing futurity; and an adverbial meaning emphasizing suitability. In this lesson's text, the character is used idiomatically with the very common expression 當 X 之時, "occupying the time of X" (i.e., "when"). Its use here is strictly unnecessary, however: X 之時 appears even more often.Radical 102 (田).Lesson 6Vocab 187
桑	sāng	Mulberry tree, mulberry-leaf harvest.For the cultural significance of the harvest, see 6.2 below.Radical 75 (木).Lesson 6Vocab 188
鄰	lín	, in Neighbor; neighboring, next; to be a neighbor to, to be next to.This character also appears as 隣, in which case it would be classified under radical 170  (阜, which has condensed form 阝 appearing on the left side).Radical 163 (邑).Lesson 6Vocab 189
夫	fū (1); fu (2--3)	1. Man, person, husband. * 2. "Now then . . . ." [particle introducing opinion] 3. This, these, that, those. [demonstrative pronoun]Radical 37 (大).Lesson 6Vocab 190
與	yŭ (1--4); yú (5)	1. And. * 2. With. [coverb]* 3. To give. 4. To belong to, to be a part of (see Lesson 21 ). 5. [Question particle.]This extremely common character has a wide variety of uses. As a conjunction, it only connects nouns, and thus it is quite different from 而. As a coverb, it is used to indicate participation of some other person or thing with the subject of the sentence; often it is impossible to distinguish whether the character is best interpreted in such cases to mean "and" or  "with" (in this lesson's text sentence, it could be either). The question particle function is used to abbreviate the character 歟.Radical 134 (臼).Lesson 6Vocab 191
妻	qī	Wife.Radical 38 (女).Lesson 6Vocab 192
俱	jū	All, together.Don't confuse this character with 具 (107) (though Chinese writers themselves sometimes used the two characters interchangeably).Radical 9 (人).Lesson 6Vocab 193
田	tián	Field.Radical 102 (田).Lesson 6Vocab 194
女	nǚ	1. Woman, girl, female, daughter. * 2. [Informal second person pronoun; used for 汝 ( 525 ).]The second meaning is found mostly in early texts.Radical 38 (女).Lesson 6Vocab 195
因	yīn	1. Thereupon, therefore. * 2. To go through, to make use of, to take advantage of.The original meaning of this character seems to be related to the word for "cushion" or  "pillow," which was written later with the grass radical (茵). Meaning #2 resulted from an abstract derivation of this meaning: someone may "lean" on a previous event or person in order to proceed to the next event, just as one "leans" on a pillow (hence, the coverbal/verbal meaning of 因---"to go through," "to make use of"). Furthermore, the most common and even more abstract meaning "thereupon" or "therefore" came about from this (an event  "leans" upon a previous event in order to occur). Unlike in Mandarin, where this character almost always implies a direct causal connection between two actions ("therefore"), in literary Chinese this character is more often a simple marker of what happens next ("thereupon").Radical 31 (囗).Lesson 6Vocab 196
追	zhuī	To pursue, to chase, to follow.Radical 162 (辵).Lesson 6Vocab 197

曠	kuàng	Empty, distant; to be alone; to be without a spouse.Note that 其曠 suggests that the author is thinking of 曠 as a noun: "his single status," "his loneliness."Radical 72 (日).Lesson 6Vocab 199

吾	wú	I, me. [first person pronoun]Although there may have been some difference between 我 and 吾 in very early China, you will find essentially no difference in their use in any text you read.Radical 30 (口).Lesson 6Vocab 201

是	shì	This, these.Note the great difference in meaning from modern Mandarin! For more on this character's use in literary Chinese, see 6.5 below.Radical 72 (日).Lesson 6Vocab 203
於是	yú shì	Thereupon (lit., "from this").This phrase is used to indicate the next event in a temporal sequence. Synonym: 因 (196).Lesson 6Vocab 11a

師	shī	1. Army. * 2. Teacher; to take as one's teacher.In meaning #1, this character is a slightly old-fashioned word for "army." In later times, 軍 (174) is used much more frequently for this meaning. Also, note that whereas 師 and 軍 can both be translated as "army," 兵 (171) refers more to the soldiers themselves and is best translated as "troops." In meaning #2 (first encountered in Lesson 20), the character is usually a noun---but as a verb it implies the act of taking on or choosing a teacher for oneself. For example: 吾師孔子, "I take Confucius as my teacher."Radical 50 (巾, "napkin,"Lesson 6Vocab 205

鼓	gŭ	1. Drum; to drum; to strum [a stringed musical instrument]. * 2. To wield, to brandish [usually a sword or a knife].Whereas this character usually refers to drums and the playing of drums, it also came to be used for the idea of strumming with the hand, or swinging a weapon.Radical 207 (鼓).Lesson 7Vocab 208

鍾	zhōng	1. To gather, to concentrate. 2. Bushel [of grain] (used to measure the salary of an official).Here, 鍾 is part of a two-character surname.Radical 167 (金, "gold," "metal").Lesson 7Vocab 210

聽	tīng (1); tìng (2)	1. To listen to, to heed. * 2. To allow, to permit, to give permission to.Generally speaking, 聞 can refer to any unintentional act of hearing, whereas 聽 tends to refer to deliberate acts of listening.Radical 128 (耳).Lesson 7Vocab 211
方	fāng	1. Just then, just at that moment. * 2. Square. 3. Scope, method, technique. 4. Direction.This character has a wide range of meanings; the adverbial use, meaning #1, is probably the most common.Radical 70 (方).Lesson 7Vocab 212
志	zhì	Ambition, will, intention, inclination.This word has important connotations in philosophy. It often refers to what one's mind is preoccupied with, sometimes even subconsciously.

巍	wéi	Lofty, eminent, imposing.As the radical suggests, this character was originally meant to describe mountains or hills, but it can describe other things as well. The reduplication of adjectives to intensify the effect is very common in literary Chinese, especially in poetry.Radical 46 (山).Lesson 7Vocab 217
若	ruò	1. To resemble, to be like; seemingly, as if, by appearance. * 2. If. 3. [Informal second person pronoun---used for 汝 ( 525 ).]In meaning #1, 若 is thought to be a dialect variant of 如 (129); consequently, 不若 has the same idiomatic meaning as 不如 (4 a).Radical 140 (艸).Lesson 7Vocab 218
少	shăo (1--2); shào (3)	1. Small; few; a little; scarce. * 2. To belittle, to consider small. 3. Young, youth.The second meaning is a good example of the "putative" use of an adjective---that is, it represents the mental attitude of a person who applies whatever the adjective is to a phe-nomenon, thing, or person.Radical 42 (小).Lesson 7Vocab 219
選	xuăn	1. To choose, to select, to elect. 2. A little bit of time. *Note! Meaning #2 (the meaning in this lesson's text) is very rare, and you will hardly ever encounter it.

間	jiān	Among, in, while.This character is used in many ways; it is like 中 (111) but with some subtle differences. 間  tends to emphasize that something is in between two other things. In time descriptions, it is used to represent an elapse of time---hence, 少選之間, "[after] a short interval of time."Radical 169 (門, "gate").Lesson 7Vocab 221

Seething; flooding. *Note! #3 is an uncommon meaning and pronuncation; #1 is much more common. Here, the character is meant to be poetically descriptive of a river, the way 巍 described hills.Radical 85 (水).Lesson 7Vocab 223
破	pò	To smash, to destroy, to break, to defeat [an army or a state]; tattered, broken-down.When used as an adjective, this character is synonymous with 弊 (137) and is in fact much more common than the latter character.Radical 112 (石, "stone").Lesson 7Vocab 224
絕	jué	To cut short, to break, to interrupt, to take a direct route or shortcut.Radical 120 (糸).Lesson 7Vocab 225
弦	xián	String [of a musical instrument], bowstring.Note the rhythm and symmetry of the four-character phrase 破琴絕弦, with its verb-object-verb-object pattern. This is a very common way of ordering language poetically in literary Chinese.Radical 57 (弓, "bow").Lesson 7Vocab 226
以為	yĭ wéi	To assume.This two-character verb emphasizes subjective opinion. Unlike in modern Mandarin, however, in literary Chinese it is not necessarily an incorrect assumption.Lesson 7Vocab 18a
世	shì	Human society, the world; the age, a generation.Radical 1 (一).Lesson 7Vocab 227
獨	dú	Alone, lonely, solitary; only.非獨, "it is not only the case that . . . ," is a common expression.Radical 94 (犬).Lesson 7Vocab 228
賢	xián	Worthy, skilled, talented; worthy man, skilled man, talented man.This word is often paired with 聖 (17), and it represents people who are good and virtuous but not quite up to the level of 聖.Radical 154 (貝).Lesson 7Vocab 229
亦	yì	1. Also, again. * 2. Indeed.Take note of the two chief uses of this very common character---it either implies repetition ("also," "again") or simply is used for emphasis. Context should make clear which meaning is appropriate.Radical 8 (亠, "above").Lesson 7Vocab 230
然	rán	1. To be so, to be thus, to be right, to act thusly. * 2. But. 3. [Optional adverb marker: "in x-manner."]Radical 86 (火).Lesson 7Vocab 231

由	yóu	1. Reason, source, origin; to come from, to derive from. 2. From. [coverb]* 3. To resemble, to be like (used as a substitute for the character 猶 [ 355-2 ]).Radical 102 (田).Lesson 7Vocab 234
奚由	xī yóu	How, why. [question word]Note: this is another inverted question expression (5.6); it could be interpreted as 由奚, "from what," that is, "how," or "why." In this sense, it is an almost exact synonym for 奚  為 (155 a).Lesson 7Vocab 155b
盡	jìn	To exhaust, to use to the fullest; exhaustively, entirely, completely, thoroughly, all, everyone.Note the two related series of meanings: a verbal usage that emphasizes exhaustion and completion (e.g., using something up), and an adverbial meaning that emphasizes that an action is thoroughly carried out or that everyone is carrying out the action.Radical 108 (皿).Lesson 7Vocab 235
驥	jì	Ji. [a proper name]The name of a legendary horse; this character is therefore by extension used as a poetic name for fast horses.Radical 187 (馬).Lesson 7Vocab 236

里	lĭ	1. Li (measurement of distance: about 1 / 3 mile). * 2. Village, ward.In meaning #2, this character can be used to describe both autonomous villages and wards, neighborhoods, or suburbs of larger towns. In some ancient texts, 里 are described as organizational units, consisting of 25, 50, 72, or 100 households.Radical 166 (里).Lesson 7Vocab 238

樂	lè (1); yuè (2)	1. To take pleasure in, to enjoy. 2. Music.This character is common in both meanings; however, in this lesson's text it is merely a personal name.Radical 75 (木).Lesson 7Vocab 240

General, commander; to command, to lead.This is a very common character; in meaning #1, it is used as an adverb to mark a future tense (and hence, can be synonymous with 當 [187 - 2]).Radical 41 (寸).Lesson 10Vocab 309

王	wáng (1); wàng (2)	1. King, prince. * 2. To take the throne, to declare oneself king, to rule as a king.Note that the rulers of 楚 had already "usurped" the title of king (see 4.1).

In imperial times, emperors generally granted the males of their family the title of 王; in such cases, it is customary to translate their titles as "prince" rather than "king."Radical 96 (玉).Lesson 10Vocab 311

酣	hān	1. Pleasantly drunk, tipsy; at the height of the party. * 2. To be at the greatest level of intensity.Generally speaking, this word is used in early texts most often in the phrase 酒酣, which usually means "when the party was under way," "when everyone was relaxed from drinking." Deriving from this usage, the character can also apply to an event or process at its moment of greatest power or extent. For example: 戰酣, "in the heat of battle."Radical 164 (酉).Lesson 10Vocab 322

避席	bì xí	To move backward on one's mat (out of politeness).This set term can be found before a description of someone speaking to a superior at a banquet or meeting; the speaker moves backward briefly, "avoiding his seat," in order to show respect for the addressee.Lesson 10Vocab 329a

實	shí	1. Fruit; to bear fruit. * 2. Truth, reality; solid, substantial, real. 3. Really, truly. 4. Honest, sincere.The various meanings of this common character seem to derive from the vegetative meaning of "fruit"; in Chinese philosophy and rhetoric, "fruit" is often contrasted metaphorically with the "less useful" products of a tree, like leaves and flowers. Consequently, 實  came to have a series of meanings tied to the idea of "substantial," "solid," "real," and hence, "true," "sincere," and so forth.Radical 40 (宀).Lesson 10Vocab 339

土	tŭ	Earth, soil, clay; land, territory.Do not confuse this character with 士 (96)! In 士 the top line is longer than the bottom line, but in 土 the bottom line is longer. If it helps, think of the longer bottom line as symbolizing the greater importance of the ground and the earth.Radical 32 (土).Lesson 10Vocab 341

莫	mò	1. No one. * 2. Don't . . . . [imperative]Be careful using this character! Technically it functions as an adverb, and it is often preceded by a defining group of people. For example, in this lesson's text we have: 左右莫  . . . , "Among the retainers, no one . . . ." Other examples: 公莫伐齊, "Of the dukes, no one attacked Qi"; 兵莫欲殺之, "Of the soldiers, no one wanted to kill him."

城	chéng	City, wall, city wall, fortress.Unlike 邑 (143), this character originally referred to the walls of the city itself. When this character is used, it is often because the writer wants to emphasize that a "fortified" city is meant; hence, the meaning of "castle" that occurs in Japanese.Radical 32 (土).Lesson 11Vocab 375

吳	wú	The state of Wu.This state was located in the Yangtze delta region. Originally evolving from a society not connected to the cultures of the Yellow River plain, 吳 gradually entered into the mainstream of Chinese history during the sixth century b.c.e. The personal names of its inhabitants (and the kings' names) are different from common northern Chinese names, perhaps reflecting their non-Chinese origins.Radical 30 (口).Lesson 12Vocab 396

僚	liáo	Companion, colleague.Here, this character is the name of a king of 吳 (r. 526--515 b.c.e.). Perhaps because the 吳 kings were considered slightly exotic or foreign, the 史記 refers to them in a different manner---吳王僚, "the king of Wu, Liao," rather than the more typical 吳僚王.Radical 9Lesson 12Vocab 401
說	shuì (1); yuè (2); shuō (3)	1. To persuade. * 2. To take pleasure in, to enjoy; to be happy. 3. Speech, discourse, story.The three major definitions of this character are all pronounced differently in modern Mandarin. Meaning #1 is used slightly differently in literary Chinese than in English, in that it represents an attempt being made to persuade, but not necessarily its success (in other words, it must often be translated as "tried to persuade," as in our lesson text here). In meaning #2, this character is being used for the more proper 悅 (748). Meaning #3 has occurred in the title of the text source for Unit 1, the Garden of Stories 說苑.Radical 149 (言).Lesson 12Vocab 402

寡人	guă rén	[First person pronoun used only by rulers.]Though early commentators disagree on this term's origins, it probably means "the orphaned one" (i.e., the ruler has a right to the throne because of the death of his father). Others assert that it is an abbreviation of 寡德之人, "I, of few virtues"---that is, that it is a polite, self-effacing term.Lesson 15Vocab 546a

陽	yáng	The yang principle (as opposed to 陰 [ 427 ]); sunlight, the sunlit side of something.You will find that 陽 is often used with the name of a river to indicate the name of a town. Because China is located in the northern hemisphere, sunlight falls from the south directly onto the northern banks of rivers, so 陽 is used to indicate the northern bank.  (With mountains, the opposite is true: 陽 is used for the southern side of a mountain, 陰 for the northern).

This character (which does not occur in its regular meaning in our texts) usually describes a forceful, physically strong man trained in the use of weapons who goes above the law to right wrongs. Sometimes viewed favorably, such men were also often seen as vigilantes or bullies. The 史記 dedicates a collective biography to them.Radical 9 (人).Lesson  a16"Vocab

或	huò	1. Someone, somebody, some people. * 2. Sometimes.Like 莫 (368 - 1), this character is used like an adverb; it is often preceded by a subject that expresses the larger group: 左右或知之, "Some of the retainers/someone among the retainers knew it"; 公或伐齊, "Some of the dukes/someone among the dukes attacked Qi"; 兵或欲殺之, "Some of the soldiers/someone among the soldiers wanted to kill him."Radical 62 (戈).Lesson 16Vocab 579
隱	yĭn	1. To hide, to conceal; hidden, obscure. * 2. To be pained by, to be upset by.Do not confuse this character with 陰 (427), though the meanings of the two characters do overlap. Meaning #2 (encountered in Lesson 25) is rare.Radical 170 (阜).Lesson 16Vocab 580
閒	jiān (1); xiàn (2)	1. Middle, midst. * 2. Leisurely, calm, idle; on vacation.In meaning #1, this character is a very common substitute for 間 (221).Radical 169 (門).Lesson 16Vocab 581

金	jīn	1. Metal. 2. Precious metal (usually gold or silver). *Since this character's meanings can be very broad, 黃金, "yellow metal," is sometimes used to specify "gold." Sometimes the character is used with a number to represent some quantity of gold or silver (compare 百金, which appears later in this lesson's text).Radical 167 (金).Lesson 16Vocab 583

壽	shòu	Long life; to toast [someone], to give a present to; a present.Since this character is a general term for "long life," the other meanings are related to it: one toasts someone in order to wish her or him long life; one gives a present in order to congratulate someone on her or his long life. 嚴仲子 is trying to make 聶政 feel obligated to him by evoking his filial feelings; a present given to his mother would have more impact on 政 than would a present given directly to him.Radical 33 (士).Lesson 16Vocab 585

謝	xiè	1. To apologize. 2. To refuse. * 3. To say farewell to; to fade, to wither (describes plants, especially flowers).Polite literary vocabulary often has overlapping meanings. This character's meanings are probably derived from "to apologize"; thus, "refuse" means "I'm sorry I can't accept that"  and "to say farewell" means "I'm sorry I have to go." There is a considerable overlap of this character and 辭 (316).Radical 149 (言).Lesson 16Vocab 587

毳	cuì	1. Down, fuzz, fur. 2. Crisp; crispy. *In meaning #2, 毳 is a substitute for the "proper" character, 脆.Radical 82 (毛, "hair").Lesson 16Vocab 592
甘毳	gān cuì	Fine, delicious food.Literary Chinese often takes adjectives that describe qualities of a thing and uses them as poetic substitutes for the thing itself. Hence, "sweet and crispy" means "good food."Lesson 16Vocab 291a
供	gòng	To supply.Radical 9 (人).Lesson 16Vocab 593

辟	bì (1); pì (2--4)	1. To avoid, to shun, to send away, to dismiss. * 2. To open up; to expand. 3. Dissolute [behavior]. 4. Eccentric, stubborn, one-sided, perverse.This character is used with a wide variety of meanings, sometimes as a simplified version of characters with added radicals. In meaning #1 (used in our lesson text), 辟 is a simplification of 避 (329). In this context, 嚴仲子 sends away his servants and others on the scene so that he can talk more privately with 聶政.Radical 160 (辛).Lesson 16Vocab 595
足下	zú xià	You (polite).This phrase is more polite in flavor than 子 (29 - 3). It derives its sense from the idea that one is so humble in the presence of a superior that one cannot address the person oneself, but one can only address the place "under his feet."Lesson 16Vocab 166a

豈	qĭ	How . . . , how could . . . .This character is used for rhetorical questions when a negative answer is expected.

To fathom, to understand fully.This character means "the very end [of something]" or "coming to the end [of something]"---  for example, using up all of one's money, following a river back to its original source, and so forth. In this sense, it is used very much like 盡 (235). However, unlike that other character, 窮 can also mean "impoverished," that is, so poor that one has no alternatives left (compare "at the end of one's rope" in English). In this meaning, it is synonymous with 貧  (588), but it is much stronger and more desperate in tone. In the second meaning, the sense is to "exhaust" some area of knowledge.Radical 116 (穴).Lesson 17Vocab 618

多	duō	Many, much; to possess many or much.Though this character is normally used as an adjective or adverb, it is not uncommon for writers to use it as a verbal abbreviation of 有多 (compare the end of this lesson's text).

Even more than 如何, it is used to indicate perplexity or indecision. Literary Chinese writers soon forgot the fusion and often placed the object of perplexity either between the two characters or after them. For example: 奈我命何 or 奈何  我命, "What can I do about my fate?"Lesson 18Vocab 667a

However, there is a fairly complicated character---嚮---which, because of its complexity, tended to be split into its two components for simplification purposes. Thus, you will find 嚮, 鄉 (the top part of the character) and 向 (1139) all used to mean "formerly," "previously," and so forth.Radical 163 (邑).Lesson 18Vocab 674
